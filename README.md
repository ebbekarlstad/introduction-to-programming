# introduction-to-programming
This repository is my work from the course "Introduction to Programming" in Python (1DV501).

### Assignment 1 and 2:
These are basic tasks in Python programming to get the hang on how programming works in a basic way.

### Mini Project:
This project includes counting unique words from text files, developing a hash-based set and a binary search tree-based map, and using these structures to analyze word frequencies and evaluate efficiency metrics like hash set bucket usage and binary search tree depth.
