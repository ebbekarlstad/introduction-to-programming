## Task 1:

- [x] Improve count_words functions to generate all unique words in a set straight away
    without having a list before it.

- [x] Improve the results printing

- [x] Call the function with both text files

## Task 2:
- Hash:
- [x] Implement a Hash Method since we are not allowed to use ASCII values according to PM (Project Manager)
- [x] Add more comments to the code

- BST:
- [x] put() function
- [x] to_string() function
- [x] count() function
- [x] get() function
- [x] max_depth() function
- [x] count_internal_nodes() function
- [x] as_list() function
- [x] remove if self is None in Node class


## Task 3:
- HashSet:
- [x] Count how many unique words that are used in the two given texts files using your HashSet implementation.
- [x] Write a Main Program that answers the point below for the HashSet of each respective data file
        - a: Bucket List Size?
        - b: Max Bucket Size?
        - c: Zero Bucket Ratio?

- BST:
- [x] Present a list of the top-10 most frequently used words having a length larger than 4 using your BstMap implementation.
- [x] Write a Main Program that answers the points below for the HashSet of each respective data file
        - a: Number of Tree Nodes ?
        - b: Max Depth?
        - c: Internal Node Count?
